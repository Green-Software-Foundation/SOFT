Business Benefits of the Transformation of Organization Software Sustainability (TOSS) framework

The TOSS framework provides companies with an approach to build a future-proof foundation for continuous improvement and change management regarding the sustainable development and use of their software operations. Rather than address green software practices on a case-by-case “point-solution” approach, the TOSS framework can allow for the organization-wide transformation to embed a company’s software practices with both cohesion and agility in matters of sustainability. 

Benefits resulting from the implementation of the TOSS framework can be grouped into the two categories of operational resilience (internal) and reputation-building (external). Internal benefits can include cost-savings due to lower energy usage from software and corresponding resistance to energy price shocks, increased adaptability and responsiveness to either regulatory or reporting changes, increased software engineer productivity due to standardized practices and lower levels of operational tech debt, and a versatile framework structure from which to incorporate any new tools, methods, and regulations into software operations. Asides from direct cost savings, TOSS enables for the added benefits of increased efficiency, transparency, and operational robustness. 

Regarding reputation-building, the incorporation of the TOSS framework can have consequential internal and external effects. A company with enduring sustainable practices can attract and retain a talent pool that has become increasingly purpose-driven. Moreover, employees who feel connected to the sustainable values of a company can innovate for efficiencies in further promoting sustainability. Externally, consumers or clients with sustainability concerns, or simply choosing between services/products, may decide on a company due to its sustainability performance, which also bolsters the clients’ own sustainability profile. Finally, a consistent and purposeful approach to organization software sustainability can enable a company to emerge as a thought-leader in their industry or sector, benfitting both their brand reputation and recognition.  

As software becomes a greater part of everyday business and personal life, it will inevitability produce unintended externalities. While technology can be a part of the solution, the TOSS framework builds a structure into companies to ensure it does not also become part of the problem as we collectively work towards a more sustainable world.
