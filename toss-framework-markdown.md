# Transforming Organisations for Sustainable Software (TOSS) Framework

# Introduction to TOSS

The Green Software Foundation has been building the methods, tools, standards, and patterns to help both developers and operational engineers embed green software practices. To first use these tools and embed them in organisations, we require a framework that provides changemakers with an approach to adopting, using, and reducing carbon emissions from running software applications.

Implementing measures to reduce software carbon emissions can result in sustainable applications and have a positive effect on the net zero targets set by businesses. This impacts the procurement of fewer offsets to attain carbon neutrality. In addition, reducing emissions requires software to use fewer IT resources, resulting in cost reductions for businesses. A cost-benefit analysis can provide guidance on the necessity of adding an incremental feature if its implementation will generate X quantity of CO2e that requires offsetting. The framework will consider the implementation of green software approaches from both the top down (organisation strategy) and the bottom up (DevOps community).

The initiative also draws from a doctoral study that looks at how change management specialists might develop technology projects that include energy-saving and carbon-emission-reducing tactics. Details about the doctoral study's interaction with GSF and its governance structure are provided in the terms of reference.

There is also a project in progress that focuses on the maturity matrix model (Community WG) for organisations to assess where they are on their green software journey. The following opportunities will be explored across both projects:

- Identify gaps in organisations—this project involves implementing various tools and practices within an organisation, and the maturity matrix model assesses the current state of the organisation.

- The maturity matrix model provides the inputs for this framework. The assessment is to understand the organisation's current capabilities, determine intermediary steps and target states, and develop a roadmap for improved sustainable IT practices and outcomes.

In simple terms, the maturity matrix model provides the assessment, and this project provides the adoption of green software practices.

# Business Case for TOSS

Business Benefits of the Transforming Organisations for Sustainable Software (TOSS) framework

With the TOSS framework, businesses can build a foundation that will last for years to come for continuous improvement and change management in the long-term growth and use of their software operations. As opposed to tackling green software practices one at a time or as "point solutions," the TOSS framework can help an organization-wide change that makes the company's software practices more sustainable and more flexible.

Benefits resulting from the implementation of the TOSS framework can be grouped into the two categories of operational resilience (internal) and reputation-building (external). Software that uses less energy and is less sensitive to changes in energy prices can save money; make the company more flexible and quick to respond to changes in regulations or reporting requirements; make software engineers more productive by standardising practices and lowering operational tech debt; and provide a framework that can be used to add any new tools, methods, or rules to software operations. Aside from direct cost savings, TOSS enables the added benefits of increased efficiency, transparency, and operational robustness.

Regarding reputation-building, the incorporation of the TOSS framework can have consequential internal and external effects. A company with enduring sustainable practices can attract and retain a talent pool that has become increasingly purpose-driven. Moreover, employees who feel connected to the sustainable values of a company can innovate for efficiencies in further promoting sustainability. Externally, consumers or clients may choose a company based on its sustainability performance if they have sustainability concerns or are simply deciding between services/products, which also enhances the clients' own sustainability profile. Finally, a consistent and purposeful approach to organisational software sustainability can enable a company to emerge as a thought leader in their industry or sector, benefiting both their brand's reputation and recognition.

As software becomes a greater part of everyday business and personal life, it will inevitably produce unintended externalities. While technology can be a part of the solution, the TOSS framework builds a structure into companies to ensure it does not also become part of the problem as we collectively work towards a more sustainable world.

## How to Apply the TOSS Pillars

The four pillars are meant to provide a linear and continuous iteration cycle that companies can apply to their organisation's structure and operations to adjust to changes in both environmental and market demands.

The Pillars have been formatted as decision tree charts. This presentation choice was made to allow for users to quickly identify where they are working in the context of the entire process and to ensure key actions are not missed in progressing to the end state.

### Engaging with the Framework

The document aligns with the four decision-making frameworks developed for Strategy, Implementation, Operational, and Compliance and Regulations Pillars. Each framework has been developed in conjunction with Green Software Members as part of PhD research project in the form of an Action Research Group.

The pillars in the framework have been developed in a Miro board - [TOSS Workshops - Decision Trees - Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK6P7Dv0=/). The Miro board view details the steps in each pillar as a flow diagram. This document supports the decision trees and provides additional context, checklists, outputs, in addition templates and guidance documentation.

As the Miro board continues to be revised, this document will be updated to reflect the changes.

## Structure of the Document

The structure of this document is as follows:

The document is split into the following key sections:

- Strategy Pillar
- Implementation Pillar
- Operational Pillar
- Compliance and Regulations Pillar
- Appendix listing all the templates and reference documents across TOSS
- Appendix detailing the personas for the Strategy pillar
- Appendix detailing the personas for the Implementation pillar
- Appendix detailing the personas for the Operations pillar
- Appendix detailing the personas for the Compliance and Regulations pillar

Within each pillar sections, there are key subsections:

- An introduction to the pillar
- Each stage within the pillar
- An introduction of each stage within the pillar
- The personas associated with each stage within the pillar
- The capability assessment table for each stage
- The steps and outputs for each stage
- The checklist for key items for each stage

### Capability Assessment Tables

1. Review Each Key Step: Determine how the organisation currently addresses these regulatory integration and sustainability steps.

2. Select the Maturity Level (Basic, Developing, or Advanced) that best describes the current state.

3. Tick the box that is applicable to the organisation, and work towards achieving the desired maturity level for each step.

4. Use the assessment as a reference to monitor the progress of the organisation

5. The assessment table also enables organisations to start at different levels of maturity within each stage.

### Steps and Output

These sections outline the key steps for each stage, specifying the required activities. Additionally, a list of outputs and artefacts for each stage is provided. Example templates and reference documents are included to serve as a foundational guide. Please note that these documents are not exhaustive and should be viewed as reference materials only.

### Checklist

Each pillar has numerous stages describing the choices and actions. Within each stage a checklist has been formed to provide a list to ensure that all necessary tasks, steps, or requirements are completed in a systematic manner. It serves as a clear and organised list of items or actions to be reviewed or accomplished, helping to prevent oversight and promote efficiency. By marking off each item as it is completed, a checklist provides a sense of clarity.

# Strategy Pillar

In the context of an organisation, the strategy pillar refers to a comprehensive plan developed to achieve specific long-term goals. The strategy pillar of the TOSS framework is all about creating and maintaining a long-lasting IT strategy that takes into account how the use and development of technology affects the environment. The pillar has scope to also incorporate social and governance topics in future iterations.

This pillar captures five key stages that propose essential questions and actions to consider. The following section highlights the key areas, the personas for each stage, and the underlying steps and outputs. The key focus is carbon emissions, but other metrics would follow the same process. The detailed framework and decision tree are available on request.

## Stage 1 -- Strategy Formation

The Strategy Formation section covers the creation of a governance approach to establish and maintain the IT sustainability strategy. This is essential in later decision-making needed for the organisation seeking to transform their software sustainability. Many of the future steps will require governance decision-making based on relevance, priority, and magnitude of actions.

Key areas of focus include analysis, planning, integration, and implementation, as well as inspection and adaptation.

## Stage 4 -- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Key areas to focus on include the quantifiable measures for evaluating KPIs. The strategic approach to establishing and measuring KPIs encompasses the organisation's current assessment and the development of training plans.

The KPI section determines the specific metrics required to monitor the progress of selected OKRs. As part of choosing the performance indicator, the Maturity Matrix is used to find the "current state." This procedure sets a baseline that can be checked on a regular basis. Additionally, employees should be educated on the strategy's KPIs and how their actions affect them.
