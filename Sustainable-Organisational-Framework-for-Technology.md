# Sustainable Organisational Framework for Technology (SOFT)

## Introduction to SOFT

The Green Software Foundation has been building the methods, tools, standards, and patterns to help both developers and operational engineers embed green software practices. To first use these tools and embed them in organisations, we require a framework that provides changemakers with an approach to adopting, using, and reducing carbon emissions from running software applications.

Implementing measures to reduce software carbon emissions can result in sustainable applications and have a positive effect on the net zero targets set by businesses. This impacts the procurement of fewer offsets to attain carbon neutrality.  In addition, reducing emissions requires software to use fewer IT resources, resulting in cost reductions for businesses. A cost-benefit analysis can provide guidance on the necessity of adding an incremental feature if its implementation will generate X quantity of CO2e that requires offsetting. The framework will consider the implementation of green software approaches from both the top down (organisation strategy) and the bottom up (DevOps community).

The initiative also draws from a doctoral study that looks at how change management specialists might develop technology projects that include energy-saving and carbon-emission-reducing tactics. Details about the doctoral study's interaction with GSF and its governance structure are provided in the terms of reference.

There is also a project in progress that focuses on the maturity matrix model (Community WG) for organisations to assess where they are on their green software journey. The following opportunities will be explored across both projects:

- Identify gaps in organisations—this project involves implementing various tools and practices within an organisation, and the maturity matrix model assesses the current state of the organisation.
- The maturity matrix model provides the inputs for this framework. The assessment is to understand the organisation's current capabilities, determine intermediary steps and target states, and develop a roadmap for improved sustainable IT practices and outcomes.

In simple terms, the maturity matrix model provides the assessment, and this project provides the adoption of green software practices.

## Business Case for SOFT
Business Benefits of the Sustainable Organisational Framework for Technology (SOFT) framework

With the SOFT framework, businesses can build a foundation that will last for years to come for continuous improvement and change management in the long-term growth and use of their software operations. As opposed to tackling green software practices one at a time or as "point solutions," the SOFT framework can help an organization-wide change that makes the company's software practices more sustainable and more flexible. 

Benefits resulting from the implementation of the SOFT framework can be grouped into the two categories of operational resilience (internal) and reputation-building (external). Software that uses less energy and is less sensitive to changes in energy prices can save money; make the company more flexible and quick to respond to changes in regulations or reporting requirements; make software engineers more productive by standardising practices and lowering operational tech debt; and provide a framework that can be used to add any new tools, methods, or rules to software operations. Aside from direct cost savings, SOFT enables the added benefits of increased efficiency, transparency, and operational robustness. 

Regarding reputation-building, the incorporation of the SOFT framework can have consequential internal and external effects. A company with enduring sustainable practices can attract and retain a talent pool that has become increasingly purpose-driven. Moreover, employees who feel connected to the sustainable values of a company can innovate for efficiencies in further promoting sustainability. Externally, consumers or clients may choose a company based on its sustainability performance if they have sustainability concerns or are simply deciding between services/products, which also enhances the clients’ own sustainability profile. Finally, a consistent and purposeful approach to organisational software sustainability can enable a company to emerge as a thought leader in their industry or sector, benefiting both their brand's reputation and recognition.  

As software becomes a greater part of everyday business and personal life, it will inevitably produce unintended externalities. While technology can be a part of the solution, the SOFT framework builds a structure into companies to ensure it does not also become part of the problem as we collectively work towards a more sustainable world.  

## How to Apply the SOFT Pillars

The four pillars are meant to provide a linear and continuous iteration cycle that companies can apply to their organisation's structure and operations to adjust to changes in both environmental and market demands.

The Pillars have been formatted as decision tree charts. This presentation choice was made to allow for users to quickly identify where they are working in the context of the entire process and to ensure key actions are not missed in progressing to the end state.

### Engaging with the Framework
The document aligns with the four decision-making frameworks developed for Strategy, Implementation, Operational, and Compliance and Regulations Pillars. Each framework has been developed in conjunction with Green Software Members as part of PhD research project in the form of an Action Research Group. 

The pillars in the framework have been developed in a Miro board - [SOFT Workshops - Decision Trees - Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK6P7Dv0=/). The Miro board view details the steps in each pillar as a flow diagram. This document supports the decision trees and provides additional context, checklists, outputs, in addition templates and guidance documentation.

As the Miro board continues to be revised, this document will be updated to reflect the changes.

### Structure of the Document
The structure of this document is as follows:

The document is split into the following key sections:
- Strategy Pillar
- Implementation Pillar
- Operational Pillar
- Compliance and Regulations Pillar
- Appendix listing all the templates and reference documents across SOFT
- Appendix detailing the personas for the Strategy pillar
- Appendix detailing the personas for the Implementation pillar
- Appendix detailing the personas for the Operations pillar
- Appendix detailing the personas for the Compliance and Regulations pillar

Within each pillar sections, there are key subsections:

- An introduction to the pillar
- Each stage within the pillar
- An introduction of each stage within the pillar
- The personas associated with each stage within the pillar
- The capability assessment table for each stage
- The steps and outputs for each stage
- The checklist for key items for each stage

### Capability Assessment Tables
1. Review Each Key Step: Determine how the organisation currently addresses these regulatory integration and sustainability steps.
1. Select the Maturity Level (Basic, Developing, or Advanced) that best describes the current state.
1. Tick the box that is applicable to the organisation, and work towards achieving the desired maturity level for each step.
1. Use the assessment as a reference to monitor the progress of the organisation
1. The assessment table also enables organisations to start at different levels of maturity within each stage.

### Steps and Output
These sections outline the key steps for each stage, specifying the required activities. Additionally, a list of outputs and artefacts for each stage is provided. Example templates and reference documents are included to serve as a foundational guide. Please note that these documents are not exhaustive and should be viewed as reference materials only.

### Checklist
A checklist is a simple tool used to ensure that all necessary tasks, steps, or requirements are completed in a systematic manner. It serves as a clear and organized list of items or actions to be reviewed or accomplished, helping to prevent oversight and promote efficiency. By marking off each item as it is completed, a checklist provides a sense of clarity.

## Strategy Pillar

In the context of an organisation, the strategy pillar refers to a comprehensive plan developed to achieve specific long-term goals. The strategy pillar of the SOFT framework is all about creating and maintaining a long-lasting IT strategy that takes into account how the use and development of technology affects the environment. The pillar has scope to also incorporate social and governance topics in future iterations.

This pillar captures five key stages that propose essential questions and actions to consider. The following section highlights the key areas, the personas for each stage, and the underlying steps and outputs. The key focus is carbon emissions, but other metrics would follow the same process. The detailed framework and decision tree are available on request.

### Stage 1 - Strategy Formation

The Strategy Formation section covers the creation of a governance approach to establish and maintain the IT sustainability strategy. This is essential in later decision-making needed for the organisation seeking to transform their software sustainability. Many of the future steps will require governance decision-making based on relevance, priority, and magnitude of actions.

Key areas of focus include analysis, planning, integration, and implementation, as well as inspection and adaptation.

### Stage 3 - Sustainable IT Objective Key Results (OKRs)

The OKR section takes into account the business strategy, the importance of the metrics, and the availability of data from the previous sections. It then decides if certain performance metrics should be tracked as OKRs. The oversight committee/board from section 1 should be involved in the decision-making process.

Key areas to focus on include the development of sustainable IT OKRs, defining the objectives, and being able to measure them through Key Performance Indicators.

### Stage 4 - Training and Assessment

Effective training initiatives are essential for equipping teams with the necessary knowledge and competencies to embed and advance sustainable practices within an organisation. Such training programmes must clearly articulate sustainable development acronyms, relevant methodologies, best practices, and specific techniques to enable a comprehensive understanding and effective implementation.

Tracking the progress and effectiveness of training programmes is crucial. This includes maintaining detailed records of participation, gathering feedback from participants to evaluate training effectiveness, and assessing the ongoing application of knowledge and skills gained through training.

Complementing training efforts, regular assessments of an organisation's green maturity are conducted. These assessments provide insights into the organisation's sustainability journey, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. A structured and periodic approach to these assessments ensures continuous monitoring and facilitates informed decision-making aimed at achieving targeted sustainability objectives.

Key indicators of successful training and assessment programmes include participation statistics, qualitative feedback from training sessions, and quantitative scores derived from Green Maturity Matrix evaluations. Collectively, these metrics offer a comprehensive view of organisational readiness and progression towards sustainability goals.

### Stage 5 - Measurement Targets

Key areas to focus include the measurement targets for KPI's and the ability to track progress and performance. The Measurement Targets section makes sure that the data being collected can be used to report to outside groups in a way that meets industry standards and to track progress against OKRs and introduce changes to the company's IT strategy that are sustainable.

If all OKRs and KPIs are supported in the implementation and already available for use in IT operations, SOFT users can skip over the Implementation Pillar and move on to the Operations Pillar.

## Implementation Pillar
Implementation within organisations is the structured process of executing the IT sustainable strategy and implementing the tools and processes to meet the objectives and KPI’s. Key components of this process include refining and enhancing tools to support organisational processes; setting up systems for effective data collection; and ensuring accuracy through validation. Tracking progress involves monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) and analysing the data to assess performance and make informed adjustments. Data aggregation then compiles information from various sources to provide a comprehensive view, while trend analysis identifies patterns over time to guide strategic planning. Together, these elements ensure the effective and efficient implementation of organisational objectives.

### Stage 6 – Implementation / Refinement of Tooling

Key areas of focus include the evaluation and selection of tools.

#### Steps and Outputs
**Steps:**

a. Determine the type of solution for the IT Sustainable Strategy (in-house development, purchased, or a combination). 
b. Check for any upcoming regulatory impacts.
c. Based on the OKR’s and KPIs, create the associate databases/flows to capture the metrics.
d. Set up the frequency to update the metrics based on the cadence set by the leadership and oversight committee.

**Outputs:**

e. Energy Usage Metric Database – Example Energy Usage - Database Schema
f. Water Usage Metric Database – Example Water Usage – Database Schema
g. Electronic Waste Database – Example Electronic Waste - Database Schema
h. Sustainable Procurement Database – Example Sustainable Procurement - Database Schema

The implementation and refinement of tooling cover selecting, customising, and enhancing tools to support the IT organisation's sustainability processes by evaluating existing tools, identifying gaps, and refining or implementing new ones to boost efficiency, productivity, and goal alignment.

### Stage 9 - Validate Data Accuracy

Validating data accuracy is essential to ensure the reliability of the data collected for carbon metrics. This type of validation involves checking the data for errors, inconsistencies, and completeness. Validation processes may include cross-referencing data with other sources, conducting audits, and using automated tools to detect anomalies. Accurate data is crucial for making sound decisions and assessments.

Key areas of focus include the validation of data. In this section, we refer to carbon data.

### Stage 10 - Tracking & Analysis Data Aggregation

Tracking and analysis involve monitoring the progress and performance of implemented tools and processes for carbon. The process includes collecting data on key performance indicators (KPIs), analysing this data to assess performance against targets, and identifying trends or issues that need to be addressed. Effective tracking and analysis enable organisations to make informed decisions and necessary adjustments to their implementation plans.

Key areas of focus include the monitoring and performance of the metrics. In this section, we refer to carbon data.

### Stage 11 - Trend Analysis

Trend analysis is the examination of data over time to identify patterns, trends, and insights for carbon usage data. The process involves analysing aggregated data to detect changes, forecast future performance, and inform strategic planning. Trend analysis helps organisations understand the effectiveness of their implementation efforts and make proactive adjustments to stay on track with their goals.

Key areas of focus include the identification of patterns and trends to provide insights. In this section, we refer to carbon data.

## Operational Pillar

Operational strategies within organisations are essential for maximising overall performance, advancing sustainability initiatives, and achieving key business objectives in a competitive and rapidly evolving landscape. These strategies embrace a comprehensive range of methods, frameworks, and practices aimed at enhancing efficiency and effectiveness across various operational domains while aligning with broader organisational goals. By integrating sustainability into operational strategies, organisations can reduce their environmental impacts, drive innovation, create value for stakeholders, and improve resilience in the face of regulatory, market, and societal changes.

An operational strategy is a vital framework for enhancing organisational performance, driving sustainability, and achieving key business objectives. It involves a coordinated set of practices and methods aimed at improving efficiency, effectiveness, and environmental responsibility across all operational areas. By lining up these parts with goals, an operational strategy encourages new ideas, adaptability, and value creation while lowering the impact on the environment. This feature helps a business succeed in the long term in a way that is both competitive and sustainable. This pillar will continuously evolve based on the strategy and implementation pillar.

## Compliance and Regulations Pillar

Compliance and regulations are essential for organisations to ensure transparency by disclosing sustainability efforts, meeting legal requirements, and aligning with business objectives. These strategies involve robust governance, proactive assessment of regulations, effective stakeholder management, and clear communication. By focusing on data gathering, auditing, and reporting, organisations can bridge gaps between current practices and regulatory demands, ensuring environmental accountability while driving business success.

### Stage 19 - Governance

Strong governance frameworks establish accountability and oversight, ensuring compliance strategies are effectively implemented and aligned with organisational goals.

### Stage 26 - Business Delivery

Compliance and regulations are critical components of organisational sustainability efforts--- ensuring that companies meet legal requirements, disclose their sustainability measures, and align these efforts with broader business objectives. These strategies involve implementing governance structures, adhering to environmental regulations, and proactively assessing new regulatory developments. By conducting gap analyses, managing stakeholder relationships, and ensuring transparent reporting, organisations can address deficiencies and foster accountability. Effective communication and integration of compliance measures in business operations enable companies to enhance their environmental performance while achieving operational excellence and long-term value creation.

Integrating compliance into business delivery ensures sustainability objectives are seamlessly embedded into operations, driving efficiency and long-term success.
